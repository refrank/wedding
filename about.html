					 <p style="text-align:left">Hey! Rebecca here. I want to let y'all in on something. My wedding dress isn't white (or beige, or gold or peach). Some have asked me why that is and I've had the chance to answer them. I knew I wouldn't have the luxury of one-on-one chats about this with everyone we're inviting. Yet, some of you might be curious when you see me, so just wanted to share a few of my thoughts here. 
						<br><br>
						First – and this is big – I don't have anything against the plethora of people who have chosen to wear white on their wedding day. The bride at every wedding I've been to has worn white and I have yet to see a couple be less than ravishing on their wedding day.
						<br><br>
						I've long been one to play around with personal style. When I was a toddler I renounced frilly, lace socks. When I was in elementary school I wore one ladybug jumper for weeks on end. I've been through phases of wearing all black, all rainbow, and nothing but bowling shoes. (I know, right?) I had no assumptions of what I would wear for my wedding and had fun considering everything from a glittery pant suit to going barefoot to making my own outfit from scratch. 
						<br><br>
						The history of white becoming the default wedding color is interesting. It's replete with both beautiful symbolism, and other less-than-beautiful -isms (like classicism, and sexism). When it came down to it, it wasn't something I felt a personal connection to. 
						<br><br>
						I don't believe people who wear white are wrong/stupid/old-fashioned/[fill in negative adjective here].
						<br><br>
						I do believe in the right to an individual's choice. 
						<br><br>
						I want what most people want on their wedding day: to be happy, healthy and surrounded by those I care about most. 
						<br><br>
						As my best friend, Kasey, always says: “You do you.” And that's what I'm going for. I'm excited that we're edging ever closer to a world where there a multitidue of “right” answers and you just have find the one that suits you best.
